# Research Proposal Presentation (70 %) – Self‑evaluation  

**WHAT (recap).** The proposal asked: *“How can explainable deep‑learning techniques improve clinical decision‑making in medical imaging?”* I produced 19 slides and a 7‑minute narration.

**SO WHAT (critique).** Feedback rated all five rubric areas as “Excellent” 444274_RRP Summative Feedback Template (Research Proposal Presentation).pdf](file-service://file-7iYPtHV7Ut3aCQPoSD5W4k), highlighting pace, clarity, and critical balance between theoretical context and real‑world constraints. The jump from 52 % (review) to 70 % reflected three deliberate improvements:

1. **Full story arc.** I opened with a clinical vignette to humanise the research gap.  
2. **Methodological depth.** Used a diagram of the XAI pipeline, then critiqued Grad‑CAM’s localisation bias.  
3. **Practice reflection.** Addressed feasibility, ethics, and data‑protection, aligning with *World Medical Association, 2023* guidance.

Areas to grow:

* **Strengths vs. limitations deep‑dive.** Tutor suggested probing constraints further (e.g., annotation cost in CT).  
* **Delivery tempo.** Pacing was steady but could be more dynamic to sustain engagement (Reynolds, 2021).  
* **Source density.** Five seminal papers is solid, yet a systematic review could uncover missing edge cases.

**NOW WHAT (action plan).**

* Add a dedicated “threats to validity” slide in future defences, using Maxwell’s *interactive model* as a checklist.  
* Practice *pecha‑kucha* (20 s × 20 slides) once per fortnight to sharpen timing.  
* Register a PROSPERO protocol to develop the XAI systematic review; target submission next semester.

Overall, the presentation confirmed that embracing feedback, word‑count discipline and narrative coherence can shift work from *satisfactory* to *excellent*. My next milestone is to embed a deeper limitation analysis culture across all outputs.
