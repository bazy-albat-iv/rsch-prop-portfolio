# Personal SWOT analysis (fill in your points below)

| **Strengths** | **Weaknesses** |
|---------------|----------------|
| Self‑directed learner: Comfortable sourcing docs, demanding citations, and iterating until answers click. | Limited formal research exposure: My classic academic writing and research may need polishing. |

| **Opportunities** | **Threats** |
|-------------------|-------------|
| Access to tutors, academic writing support, and peer forums—use for feedback on dissertations or to find research collaborators | 	Heavy developer workload + newborn + coursework risks burnout. |
