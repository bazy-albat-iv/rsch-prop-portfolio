# Critical Reflection (Rolfe *What? So What? Now What?*)  

> *“We are products of our past, but we don’t have to be prisoners of it.”*  
> — Rick Warren

## Introduction (WHAT)  
This module unfolded against the backdrop of a divorce and ongoing legal battles that drained time, focus, and confidence. Attendance slipped after Unit 5; I missed several optional tasks and submitted key assignments under psychological fog. Yet three artefacts – statistics exercises, the literature review (52 %), and the proposal presentation (70 %) – form a trajectory from doubt to competence. This reflection interrogates **(1)** my statistical‑analysis skills, **(2)** my understanding of the research‑methods process, and **(3)** the impact on my professional growth, drawing on Rolfe et al.’s (2001) reflective model.

## 1. Statistical‑analysis skills  

### WHAT  
Before Unit 8 I had never run an inferential test outside MOOC exercises. Completing the paired‑sample and one‑sample *t*‑tests felt mechanical: follow the JASP wizard, copy the output.  

### SO WHAT  
Interpreting the numbers sparked genuine insight. Rejecting H₀ for the packaging study (*p*=0.018) showed how a **13‑item mean gap** could drive a costly production decision. Linking the cereal‑weight test to quality control connected statistics with tangible business stakes. Emotionally, these small wins chipped away at the imposter syndrome amplified by my personal life crisis: the data did not care about my divorce; it yielded to method.

### NOW WHAT  
I will practise one test each week using *Real‑Statistics* datasets, then log the rationale and assumptions in the e‑Portfolio. By June I aim to tackle a two‑way ANOVA, preparing for my dissertation’s multifactor imaging study.

## 2. Research‑methods process  

### WHAT  
The literature review exposed gaps in my critical synthesis; feedback cited word‑count under‑use and descriptive style. Conversely, the proposal excelled in criticality and structure.

### SO WHAT  
The contrast underscored that **process discipline** – not raw intellect – drives quality. For the proposal I storyboarded, iterated with peers, and rehearsed delivery. Those habits were absent in the earlier review. Experiencing a 52 % → 70 % leap reframed feedback from a verdict to a *diagnostic tool* (Boud & Molloy, 2013). Emotionally, this validated my ability to rebound after setbacks, mirroring the resilience I needed in court hearings.

### NOW WHAT  
I have integrated an **evidence‑trail workflow**: Zotero collection → compare/contrast matrix → narrative outline → peer review → final edit. Each stage logs decisions in the GitHub repo, providing transparency and easing future meta‑analysis.

## 3. Professional impact (skills matrix & SWOT)  

### WHAT  
Completing the SWOT revealed strengths in machine‑learning acumen and resilience, but weaknesses in time‑management under stress and academic writing finesse.

### SO WHAT  
The exercise surfaced a tension: industry values rapid prototyping, whereas academia demands slow, critical depth. My divorce dragged me toward the former (“just ship it”), but the proposal pulled me back to rigorous justification. Recognising this duality clarifies career pathways: a translational research role where both speed and rigour matter.

### NOW WHAT  
Actions for 2025:  

* **Strengthen writing.** Join the faculty’s 6‑week “Writing for Publication” clinic.  
* **Stress inoculation.** Schedule study sprints before legal appointments; use Pomodoro blocks plus mindfulness resets.  
* **Network leverage.** Collaborate with radiology PhDs for data access, turning the proposal into a pilot study.

## Conclusion  

This module became a live laboratory for resilience. The statistical tests taught me to trust evidence over emotion; the literature‑review stumble proved that word‑count discipline equals thinking discipline; the proposal success demonstrated that structured process can thrive even amid personal turmoil. Rolfe’s final question – **NOW WHAT?** – points to an actionable roadmap: weekly stats practice, a transparent research workflow, and targeted skill‑building. My divorce and legal battles no longer define my academic identity; they are context for a narrative of reflective, evidence‑based growth.
