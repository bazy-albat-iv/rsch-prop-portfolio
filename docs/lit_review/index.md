# Literature Review (52 %) – Self‑evaluation  

**WHAT (brief recap).** My review surveyed deep‑learning applications in radiology. I submitted only 1 300 of the 2 500 allocated words and structured the piece as bullet‑point mini‑sections.

**SO WHAT (critique).** Karen Outram’s feedback noted that using “50 % of the word count… has limited the critical content” and that I relied on “listing… instead of full paragraphs” 436379_RRMP Summative Feedback Template (Literature Review) (3).pdf](file-service://file-GFBsy8y9HDrCQeCVTFTCow). In hindsight, the truncated length forced me to *describe* rather than interrogate sources. I also conflated **coverage** (breadth) with **critique** (depth) – a common novice error (Ridley, 2012).

Formatting issues (font, spacing) cost presentation marks and signalled haste. More seriously, I failed to connect competing viewpoints: e.g., I listed Grad‑CAM advantages yet never weighed them against saliency‑map limitations. That broke the golden thread of argumentation (Booth et al., 2016).

**NOW WHAT (action plan).**

* **Word‑count strategy.** Draft to 120 % of the limit, then compress; never under‑shoot again.  
* **Critical matrix.** Adopt a two‑column compare/contrast table during reading to force evaluation rather than summary.  
* **Paragraph discipline.** Use the PEE(L) model (Point‑Evidence‑Explanation‑Link) for every key source.  
* **Formatting checklist.** Create an APA/Harvard template in Word and run a pre‑submission style macro.  

By applying these changes I expect future reviews to progress from *satisfactory* to *good* on the programme rubric.
