## 1 · Paired‑sample *t*‑test – container designs

![Design test output](/rsch-prop-portfolio/images/paired-t-test-1-design.png)

**Scenario.** Ten stores tested two packaging designs.  
**Result.** Mean difference = 13.2 items (Design 1 > Design 2); *t*(9)=2.87, *p*=0.018.  
Because *p* \< 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis: Design 1 significantly out‑performs Design 2 in sales.

_Assumptions met_: independence of paired observations; approximate normality of the difference scores was checked via a histogram and appeared reasonable.

## 2 · One‑sample *t*‑test – cereal box weight

![Cereal test output](/rsch-prop-portfolio/images/sample-t-test-2-cereal.png)

**Scenario.** The label weight is 500 g. Sixteen boxes were sampled.  
**Result.** Mean = 501.9 g; *t*(15)=1.95, one‑tailed *p*=0.035.  
We reject H₀ and conclude the line is over‑filling by ≈ 1.9 g on average.

_Assumptions met_: Shapiro–Wilk test confirmed normality of weights; independence assumed from random sampling procedure.
