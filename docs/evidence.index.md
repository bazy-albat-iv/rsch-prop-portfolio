# Evidence Bundle  

This page collates four key artefacts produced during the module.  
Short annotations (≈ 80 words each) demonstrate *what* I did and *what* I learned.

| Unit | Artefact | Annotation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Weeks 1‑3** | ![Discussion screenshot](../../images/collaborative discussion-1.png) | **WHAT.** Posted once in a collaborative thread on *accessibility in research ethics*. Peers echoed my data‑misuse worries but no one replied directly to me.<br>**SO WHAT.** Late posting meant little engagement; I felt my input lacked value.<br>**NOW WHAT.** Post at least 48 h before the deadline so peers/tutor can respond, and tag specific classmates to invite dialogue. |
| **Unit 5** | ![Cambridge Analytica case study](../../images/review-1.png) | **WHAT.** Analysed the Cambridge Analytica scandal as a survey‑ethics case study.<br>**SO WHAT.** Discovered that large firms prioritise *being caught* over true data stewardship, shifting my trust model from institutions to user agency.<br>**NOW WHAT.** Adopted privacy‑segmented identities (alt e‑mail, phone) for low‑stakes sites; will embed stronger consent language in future research instruments. |
| **Literature Review** | ![Lit‑review excerpt](../../images/lit-review-1.png) | **WHAT.** 1 300‑word review on deep‑learning in medicine; scored **52 %** (feedback: under‑length, descriptive, fragmented) 436379_RRMP Summative Feedback Template (Literature Review) (3).pdf](file-service://file-GFBsy8y9HDrCQeCVTFTCow).<br>**SO WHAT.** Word‑count anxiety led me to cut depth; listing headers replaced full paragraphs, limiting criticality.<br>**NOW WHAT.** Plan outlines around *full* word budget; draft in prose first, then trim. |
| **Research Proposal** | ![Proposal slides 1](../../images/rsh-prop -1.png) ![Proposal slides 2](../../images/rsh-prop -2.png) | **WHAT.** Presentation on *“How can explainable deep learning improve clinical decision‑making in imaging?”* Scored **70 %** (excellent across rubric) 444274_RRP Summative Feedback Template (Research Proposal Presentation).pdf](file-service://file-7iYPtHV7Ut3aCQPoSD5W4k).<br>**SO WHAT.** Validated the adjustments I made: deeper critical lens and tight structure.<br>**NOW WHAT.** Maintain that research pipeline and, per feedback, deepen the strengths/limitations analysis in future studies. |

*Total annotation word‑count: ≈ 340 (within 1 500‑word evidence allowance).*
